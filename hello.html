            These changes can be attributed to Robert McNamara, who was appointed to the presidency in 1968 by Lyndon B.

Rotberg used the global bond market to increase the capital available to the bank.[12] One consequence of the period of poverty alleviation lending was the rapid rise of Third World debt. From 1976 to 1980, developing world debt rose at an average annual rate of 20%.[1]
